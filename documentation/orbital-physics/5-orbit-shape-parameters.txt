### orbit shape specific parameters: ###

# Ellipse and circle ecc < 1:
Ea = 2 * arctan(sqrt((1 - e)/(1 + e)) * tan(Ta / 2))%2pi   # eccentric anomaly from true anomaly [1]
Ma = (Ea - e * sin(Ea))   # mean anomaly from Keplers equation [2]
tPe = T - (Ma * T / (2pi))   # time to periapsis [6]
tN = T - (Ma * T / (2pi)) - (phi * T / (2pi))   # time to point on orbit, point is given by angle phi starting from periapsis
# time to point on orbit is calcuated as difernce of time to Pe from current point and time to Pe from target point
tN = T - (Ma + phi)(T / (2pi))%T   # above equation simplified
tAp = T - (Ma + pi)(T / (2pi))%T   # time to apoapsis

# Parabola ecc = 1:

# Hyperbola ecc > 1:

### Keplerian orbit ###
# (only for simplified orbit model)

i = 0   # inclination (for 3D)
asc_node = 0   # longitude of ascending node (for 3D)
n = [-Lx, Lz, 0]   # vector to ascending node (for 3D)
Pr = P2 - P1   # relative position vector
vr = v2 - v1   # relative velocity vector
u = G * m   # standard gravitational parameter
a = -1 * u / (2*(|vr|^2 / 2 - u / |Pr|))   # semi-major axis [5], also can be calculated from vis-viva equation [9]
h = Pr x vr   # orbital momentum, since simulation is 2D, momentum is scalar
ev = (vr x h)/u - Pr/|Pr|  # eccentricity vector [10], this is general equation for 3D and 2D
# since this is 2D and h is scalar, (vr x h) cross product is not needed, so just multiply, swap axes and -y
e = |ev|   # eccentricity
f = sqrt(a^2 - b^2)   # focus
f = e * a   # focus (from: e = f / a)
b = sqrt(f^2 - a^2)   # semi-minor axis
omega = pi + arctan2(ev_y, ev_x)   # argument of periapsis [4]
    if e = 0:   # if it is circle
        omega = 0   # there is no periapsis

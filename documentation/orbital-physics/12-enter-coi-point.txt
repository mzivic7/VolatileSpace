### Predicting vessel and body ma at the moment when vessel ENTER body COI ###
# this is very hard to do with just math and newton solver, so this is custom solver algorithm

In a loop:
    If one full orbit is passed:
        Return that no COI crossings are found
    Move vessel and body with mean motion multiplied by dt
    Calculate vessel and bosy positions relative to reference
    Check distance between body and vessel
    If its smaller than body COI:
        Go to refinement

# refinement
In a limited loop:
    Calculate new dt so its x2 smaller in each loop
    if vessel is inside COI, make dt negative so vessel moves towards COI
    Move vessel and body with mean motion multiplied with dt
    Calculate vessel and bosy positions relative to reference
    Calculate distance between body and vessel
    If distance - coi < tolerance:
        return vessel_ea, body_ea, vessel_ma, body_ma, time_to_coi
if loop has ended:
    return vessel_ea, body_ea, vessel_ma, body_ma, time_to_coi

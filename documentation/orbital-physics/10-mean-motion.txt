# Body can be moved with mean motion instead with newtonian physics.
# This simplifies calculations and warp can be easier implemented

n = sqrt(G*M/|a|^3)  # general mean motion [14]
n = 2pi / T   # only for ellipse [14]

# Then increment mean anomaly by this value each iteration
# direction is added for clockwise orbits
# Simulation can simply be sped-up by multiplying with warp
Ma += direction * n * warp

# Limit Ma so it does not grow infinitely:
if Ma > 2pi:
    Ma -= 2pi
if ma < 0:
    Ma += 2pi

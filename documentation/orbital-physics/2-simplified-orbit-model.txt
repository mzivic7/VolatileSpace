### simplified orbit model ###
# (body inside COI of other body is effected only by that body)

F = m1 * m2 / d^2   # Newton's law of universal gravitation
a = F * m1   # acceleration
# body has no effect on its parrent, so above two formulas can be written in one: a = m2 / d^2
angle = arctan2(y1 - y2, x1 - x2)   # angle between 2 bodies and horizon
a_x = a * cos(angle)   # get vector from magnitude and angle 
a_y = a * sin(angle)
av = [a_x, a_y]   # acceleration vector
vr = vr + av   # update relative velocity vector
v = vr + v_p   # absolute vel from relative vel and parents absolute vel
P = P + v   # absolute position
rCOI = a1(m1 / m2)^(2/5)   # radius of circle of influence [8]

# where: 
v_p = parents absolute velocity vector
a1 = semi-major axis of smaller objects orbit around larger one
m1 = mass of smaller body
m2 = mass of larger body

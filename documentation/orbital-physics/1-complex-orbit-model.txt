### Complex orbit model (NOT USED IN SIMULATION) ###
# (each body effects every other body)

F = m1 * m2 / d^2   # Newton's law of universal gravitation
# repeat for both bodies (m1 and m2):
ac = F / m   # acceleration
angle = arctan2(y1 - y2, x1 - x2)   # angle between 2 bodies and horizon
ac_x = a * cos(angle)   # get vector from magnitude and angle 
ac_y = a * sin(angle)
av = [ac_x, ac_y]   # acceleration vector
v = v + av   # update velocity vector
P = P + v   # update position vector

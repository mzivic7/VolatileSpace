### Characteristic orbit points ###

# using math from other-physics/4-ellipse-circle.txt
# to get Ea and global point of intersection

# COLLISION WITH PLANET
# do only for ref
# obtain Ea
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# other range of orbit is darker color
# body is located in ellipse/hyperbola focus

# LEAVE COI
# do only for ref
# obtain Ea (2 points, first point is next in orbit direction, and second is previous)
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# dark color line parameter is in range: (ea_point_previous, ea_vessel)
# other range is invisible
# body is located in ellipse/hyperbola focus

# ENTER COI
# do for all planets orbiting ref
# obtain Ea
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# other range is invisible
# body is not in focus, its position must be predicted, since it is moving too


### Finding next and previous point on orbit ###
# first calculate angle between points in CCW direction
angle = abs(ea_vessel - ea_point)
# if ea_vessel is larger: invert angle
if ea_vessel > ea_point:
    angle = 2pi - angle
# if direction is clockwise: invert angle, to calculate in other direction
if direction < 0:
    angle = 2pi - angle
# do this for all points
# then sort by calculated angle
# and finally return ea_point by indices of first and last sorted angle


### Predicting vessel and body ma at the moment when vessel will cross body COI ###
# this is very hard to be done with just math and newton solver, so here is custom solver algorithm:

first, check if vessel can intersect with body (no need to check for hyperbola):
    if vessel_apoapsis is greater than body_apoapsis-COI
    a * (1 + ecc) > b_a * (1 - b_ecc) - coi
    if this is true than continue
generate probe points as vessel Ma, in such way that Ma is evenly distributed
    this makes area around vessel apoapsis more dense, because most intersections happens there
    points have such order that area around vessel apoapsis is first probed
(loop) search for initial intersection:
    take one probe point and make it new Ma
    calculate time to move vessel from current Ma to new Ma (orbital-physics/5-orbit-shape-parameters.txt)
    calculate body new Ma at that time (Ma + dr * n * time_to_new_ma)
    from it, calculate body position relative to its reference (orbital-physics/6-parametric-equations.txt)
    make body position relative to vessel orbit center:
        (b_x_n and b_y_n are calculated above)
        first, get center of ellipse/hyperbola relative to reference
        center_x = f * np.cos(omega)
        center_y = f * np.sin(omega)
        then rotate body position by its periapsis argument (b_omega):
        b_x = b_x_n * cos(b_omega - pi) - b_y_n * sin(b_omega - pi)
        b_y = b_x_n * sin(b_omega - pi) + b_y_n * cos(b_omega - pi)
        get its position relative to vessels ellipse center and rotate it by vessel periapsis argument (omega)
        b_x_r = -(cos(-omega) * (b_x - center_x) - sin(-omega) * (b_y - center_y))
        b_y_r = -(sin(-omega) * (b_x - center_x) + cos(-omega) * (b_y - center_y))
        (b_x_r and b_y_r are then used in finding intersections)
    check intersections for vessel orbit and body COI at calculated body position (other-physics/4-ellipse-circle.txt)
        if there are intersections:
            if body and vessel directions are SAME:
                select intersection that is NEXT point on orbit from current vessel Ma (explained above this algorithm)
            if body and vessel directions are OPPOSITE:
                select intersection that is PREVIOUS point on orbit from current vessel Ma
            correction = intersect position - new position
        if there are no intersections:
            check next point from probe points
            if all points are checked then there are no intersections on one full orbit
from search, initial intersections are obtained and correction is calculated for next stage

(loop) iterate to lower correction:
    apply correction to new Ma
        new Ma += correction
    everything is same as in search loop from 'calculate time' to 'check intersections'
    check intersections
        there are intersection:
            # this is the most important part, here is decided where and how much to move vessel in next iteration
            # so vessel gets closer to COI in next iteration, and correction gets significantly smaller
            first select from what point to calculate correction from its angular distance to vessel
            calculate new Ea from new Ma
            distance = abs(intersect Ea - new Ea)
            if body and vessel directions are SAME:
                select closest intersection to new position
            if body and vessel directions are OPPOSITE:
                TODO select furthest intersection to new position
            # then decide whether to move forward or backward
            if body and vessel directions are SAME: move backward
                correction = -abs(intersect position - new position)
                if vessel is outside COI and next position is in front of closest intersection:
                    correction = -correction
                    # when new position is in front of closest intersection, bt outside COI,
                    # if new position keeps moving towards intersection, it will get further
                    # because of that correction must be inverted
            if body and vessel directions are OPPOSITE: move forward
                TODO correction = abs(intersect position - new position)
        there are no intersections:
            move new position back by half correction (so in each iteration correction is decreased by half):
                correction = back * abs(correction) / 2
                back is either 1 or -1 and it is opposite sign of correction when intersection is lost
    if correction is small enough:
        stop loop and return body new Ma, vessel new Ma, and time to intersection

### Characteristic orbit points ###

# using math from other-physics/4-ellipse-circle.txt
# to get Ea and global point of intersection

# COLLISION WITH PLANET
# do only for ref
# obtain Ea
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# other range of orbit is darker color

# LEAVE ORBIT
# do only for ref
# obtain Ea (2 points, first point is next in orbit direction, and second is previous)
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# dark color line parameter is in range: (ea_point_prev, ea_vessel)
# other range is invisible

# ENTER ORBIT
# do for all planets orbiting ref
# obtain Ea
# draw only first point in orbit direction on screen
# orbit line parameter is limited to range: (ea_vessel, ea_point_next)
# other range is invisible


### Finding next and previous point on orbit ###

# first calculate angle between points in CCW direction
angle = abs(ea_vessel - ea_point)
# if ea_vessel is larger: invert angle
if ea_vessel > ea_point:
    angle = 2pi - angle
# if direction is clockwise: invert angle, to calculate in other direction
if direction < 0:
    angle = 2pi - angle
# do this for all points
# then sort by calculated angle
# and finally return ea_point by indices of first and last sorted angle

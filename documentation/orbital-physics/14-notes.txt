### notes ###
%2pi converts angle from (-pi, pi) range to (0, 2pi). It can be ignored in equations, but it is important in some calculations.
True and mean anomaly must at all times be kept in (0, 2pi) range.
%T prevents time to point going negative when passing that point, since here is needed Ma in (-p, pi) range, but (0, 2pi) is given. It can be ignored in equations, but it is important in some calculations.
-pi is added to pe_arg, this rotates its origin from right side to left, this is needed when displaying something on screen.

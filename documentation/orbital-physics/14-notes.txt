### notes ###
%2pi converts angle from (-pi, pi) range to (0, 2pi). It can be ignored in equations, but it is important in some calculations.
%T prevents time to point going negative when passing that point, since here is needed Ma in (-p, pi) range, but (0, 2pi) is given. It can be ignored in equations, but it is important in some calculations.
-pi is added to omega, tis rotates its origin from right side to left, this is needed when displaying something on screen

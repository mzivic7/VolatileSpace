Savefile is human readable plain text document, containing information of every body and vessel in simulation including simulation config and metadata.
Savefiles uses ini format.

It is divided in sections by this rule:
First section is [game_data], used for storing game related variables
Second section is called [config], it is used for physics related variables.
This section is followed with sections with object names, each section for one object.
Objects can be body and vessel.
Editor loads and uses only body objects but can edit maps without loosing vessels.
Editor by default saves in Newtonian parameters.
But if editor overwrites savefile with Keplerian parameters, it will convert from Newtonian to Keplerian.
Game mode can't change body objects.



Section parameters:

[game_data]
name = New map   # map display name
date = 08.10.2023 19:24   # date and time when map is created
time = 0   # simulation time displayed on screen (in seconds)
vessel = 0   # last selected vessel in game

[config]
gc = 1.0   # gravitational constant
rad_mult = 100.0   # radius multiplier
coi_coef = 0.7   # COI coefficient: larger coef - smaller COI
vessel_scale = 0.1   # makes vessel larger or smaller


# for bodies:
[body_name]
obj = body   # this sets object type to be body
mass = 100000   # body mass
density = 1.0   # body density
color = [70, 200, 200]   # body base color
atm_pres0 = 1.0   # atmosphere pressure at surface
atm_scale_h = 0.01   # atmosphere scale height
atm_den0 = 1.2   # atmosphere pressure to density coefficient

# bodies can have 2 formats for saving orbital parameter:
# Newtonian (position and velocity)
position = [0, 0]   # ABSOLUTE position
velocity = [0, 0]   # ABSOLUTE velocity
# Keplerian (keplers orbit)
sma = 136.3   # semi major axis
ecc = 0.1   # eccentricity
lpe = 1.9   # longitude of periapsis (radians)
mna = 2.8   # mean anomaly (radians)
ref = 5   # reference body
dir = 1   # direction


# for vessels:
[vessel_name]
obj = vessel   # this sets object type to be vessel
sma = 136.3   # semi major axis
ecc = 0.1   # eccentricity
lpe = 1.9   # longitude of periapsis (radians)
mna = 2.8   # mean anomaly (radians)
ref = 5   # reference body
dir = 1   # direction
mass = 1   # vessel mass
rot_angle = 0   # current angle of vessel rotation
rot_acc = 0.0001   # maximum vessel rotation acceleration in rad/tick^2
sprite = vessel.svg   # path to vessel sprite in "parts" dir


# NOTE:
# if orbit is hyperbolic, i.e. ecc > 1
# semi major axis (sma) will and must be negative

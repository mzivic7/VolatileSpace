System savefile is human readable plain text document, containing information of every body in simulation.
Savefiles uses ini format.
It is divided in sections by this rule:
First section called [config] i used for global variables in simulation. This section is followed with: [body1], [body2], [body3]... one section for each body in simulation.



Section parameters:

[config]
name = New map   # map display name
date = 08.10.2023 19:24   # date and time when map is created
time = 0   # simulation time displayed on screen (in seconds)
gc = 1.0   # gravitational constant
rad_mult = 100.0   # radius multiplier
coi_coef = 0.7   # COI coefficient: larger coef - smaller COI

[body_name]
mass = 100000   # body mass
density = 1.0   # body density
position = [0, 0]   # ABSOLUTE position
velocity = [0, 0]   # ABSOLUTE velocity
color = [70, 200, 200]   # body base color



Notes:
Changing time won't change orbits.
Real color is calculated by temperature and base color.
System must have at least 1 body.

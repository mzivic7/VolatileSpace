# MANUAL ROTATION #

#each vessel has its maximum rotation acceleration
# when manually rotating vessel, that maximum acc is added to rotation speed each tick while holding key:
rot_speed += rot_acc * direction
# that rotation speed is each tick added to rotation angle:
rot_angle += rot_speed
# if angle get over 2pi it is put back to 0pi and
# if angle get less than 0pi it is put back to 2pi

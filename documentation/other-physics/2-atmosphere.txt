### atmosphere ###


# To calculate density and pressure of atmosphere at specific height, there are too many variables
# and formulas change for different altitudes, some are empirical, and apply only for earth
# see [2]
# Because of that simplified equation is used where user can define 3 parameters:
# p_0 = atmosphere pressure at surface 
# p_H = atmosphere height coefficient
# rho_0 = atmosphere pressure at surface
# Atmosphere radius is point where rho < 0.001

p_h = p_0 * e^(-h/p_H)   # pressure at height [2]
rho_h = rho_0 * e^(-h/p_H)   # density at height [2]
a_h = -p_H * ln(0.001 / rho_0)   # atmosphere radius where density is 0.001

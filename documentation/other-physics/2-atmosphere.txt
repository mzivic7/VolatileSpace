### atmosphere ###


# To calculate density and pressure of atmosphere at specific height, there are too many variables
# and formulas change for different altitudes, some are empirical, and apply only for earth
# see [2]
# Because of that simplified equation is used where user can define 3 parameters:
# p_0 = atmosphere pressure at surface 
# p_H = atmosphere height coefficient
# rho_coef = atmosphere pressure to density coefficient
# Atmosphere radius is point where rho < 0.001


p_h = p_0 * e^(-h/p_H)   # pressure at height [2]
rho_h = p_h * rho_coef   # density at height [2]
a_h = -p_H * ln(0.001 / rho_coef/p_0)   # atmosphere radius (from above equations)

# Body classification
# these are not realistic classifiers

if mass is higher than threshold, body is a solid planet, otherwise it is a dwarf planet
if planet has density smaller than 1500 Kg/m^3, it is a gas planet
if effective temperature is higher than 1000 degK, it is a star
if Schwarzschild radius is greater than thermal radius: it is a black hole

# notes:
# effective temperature also has impact on deciding if body is gas planet
# but it is not implemented yet
# using thermal radius for black hole because mass multiplier is used in Schwarzschild radius calculation


# Star classification [2] [3]
Class      Te
  O     ≥ 33,000 K
  B     10,000–33,000 K
  A     7,300–10,000 K
  F     6,000–7,300 K
  G     5,300–6,000 K
  K     3,900–5,300 K
  M     2,300–3,900 K

### TIMELINE ###

v0.5.0 - game-vessel
vessel selecting, draw markers, vessel zoom
parts config
physical warp (x2, x4) when enter atmosphere (fake atmosphere temporarily)
physical warp when close to other vessel (define distance)
break regular warp when entering physical (check next iteration to not move into atmosphere)
check collisions in physical warp
add velocity in prograde/retrograde, radial/antiradial
documentation (savefiles, parts, physics)

editor: prograde/retrograde, radial/antiradial

v0.5.1 - game gui
display vessel data in right menus
separate selection for body and vessel
display selected body data in right menu

v0.5.2 - rotation
planets rotation
vessel rotation
- vessels stop rotating in regular warp
- add velocity only in facing direction
documentation

v0.5.3 - advanced body orbit
leave/enter orbit and landing point
show/hide mouseover menu for point, ap/pe leave/enter, landing
lock/unlock click menu for point, ap/pe leave/enter, landing
time-to point
distance to center
dont draw some parts of orbit

### TIMELINE ###
1. inverse functions - parabola, hyperbola
2. 2 keplerian orbit lines - predict leaving orbit
3. more advanced orbital parameters (time to point with mouse, warp to it, time to leave COI)
- v0.5.0
4. multi language
5. full keplerian physics model
6. Game: separate physics models for vessels and planets
- v0.6.0
7. Rotation
8. Game menu and basic GUI
9. collision with rotation for vessels
10. enable GPU rendering ???
- v0.7.0
11. STAR PHYSICS

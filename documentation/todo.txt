### TIMELINE ###

v0.5.0 - game-vessel
Top UI buttons
physical warp (x2, x4) when enter atmosphere (fake atmosphere temporarily)
physical warp when close to other vessel/body (define distance)
break regular warp when entering physical (check next iteration to not move into atmosphere)
check collisions in physical warp
add velocity with W/A/S/D
documentation (savefiles, parts, physics)

editor: prograde/retrograde, radial/antiradial with W/A/S/D

v0.5.1 - rotation
parts config
planets rotation
vessel rotation with A/D
vessels stop rotating in regular warp
add velocity only in facing direction with W

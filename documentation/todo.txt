### TIMELINE ###

editor: prograde/retrograde, radial/antiradial with W/A/S/D
editor: relative inserting position and velocity
bg_stars: relative stars movement to parent
global: tab when typing value switch to next
editor/game: zoom should affect bg_stars speed less

v0.5.1 - game-vessel
parts config
planets rotation
vessel rotation with A/D
vessels stop rotating in regular warp

v0.5.2 - game-vessel
velocity slider
add velocity in facing direction
entering/leaving coi
check pixel collisions

v0.5.3 - game-vessel
calculate radius around vessel from vessel size and scale
switch warp if vessel will be inside that radius

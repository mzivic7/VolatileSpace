This graphical debugger is specifically made for enter coi prediction numerical algorithm.

Relevant documentation:
COI points physics: orbital-physics/11-orbit-points.txt
Enter-COI point prediction algorithm pseudocode: orbital-physics/12-enter-coi-point.txt

usage: enter-coi-debugger [-h] [-f] [-d DISPLAY] [-v] path
Graphical debugger for enter-COI prediction numerical algorithm. See documentation for more info.
positional arguments:
  path                  path to log file or ini file containing input data.
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --fullscreen      run in fullscreen mode
  -d DISPLAY, --display DISPLAY
                        display to open fullscreen window at
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

The debugger can run in 2 modes, depending on which file is provided:
1. Log mode - by providing it log printed by enter_coi_debugger.py as command line argument.
File can have either .log or .txt extension.
Log can be printed by modifying:
`from volatilespace.physics.orbit_intersect import ...`
to `from volatilespace.physics.orbit_intersect_debug import ...`
at the beginning of `./volatilespace/physics/phys_vessel.py`
Note: log mode can't re-run simulation as ini mode can, because it is missing needed values
2. Ini mode - by providing it ini file as command input.
Ini file contains orbital parameters of vessel and body. both orbiting same reference.
Example ini file: ./documentation/enter_coi_debug_example.ini
This mode supports re-running simulation without closing debugger.
`./volatilespace/physics/orbit_intersect_debug.py` is reloaded each time, which allows live debugging.
New log file is always created when re-running simulation and instantly loaded.
